# -Global-Carbon-Emissions-Analysis
Analyzed &amp; visualized the data using MySQL &amp; Power BI

SQL: 
1. Analyzed carbon emissions data for India, identifying the maximum and minimum values of carbon emissions between 1975 and 2017.
2. Explored changes in emissions per capita between 1975 and 2017 and determined the country with the most significant and most downward emissions per capita in 2017.
3. Investigated the top 5 countries with the highest carbon emissions.

Power BI: 
1. Visualized carbon emissions reduction across 6 different sectors.
2. Provided insights of carbon emissions based on 2 parameters - Year and Country.

## About the dataset: 
There are two databases in my project: 
###### 1. Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv)
This database contains the amount of carbon emissions per capital in a country as well as total carbon emission in countries over the world. 
- Tools used: SQL to clean and analyze, PowerBI to visualize

###### 2. Reduced Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [UN - environment program](https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/)
This database contains information about how much carbon emissions can be reduced in six different sector. 
- Tool used: PowerBI to visualize
